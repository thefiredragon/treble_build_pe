## Building PHH-based Pixel Experience GSIs ##

To get started with building Pixel Experience GSI, you'll need to get familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html) as well as [How to build a GSI](https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations/wiki/How-to-build-a-GSI%3F).

First, create a new working directory for your Pixel Experience build and navigate to it:

    mkdir pixel; cd pixel

Clone this repo:

    git clone https://github.com/ponces/treble_build_pe -b twelve

Finally, start the build script:

    bash treble_build_pe/build.sh
